> This is userChrome Companion (current state as of 5/31/2025). If you're familiar with userchrome toggle.. this is my attempt at recreating it *from scratch* (with some qol adjustments).

## End Goal

ⓘ To append *any* character (🐱), or code (123) or trigger (~) to the Firefox Window; Mimicking the functionality of userChrome toggle without appending invisible (in your face characters) to the title preface; Using title manipulation to trigger userChrome (css) styles. First attempt was a failure.. So lets try this again.

## Functionality

If I turn on an "option" in userChrome Companion, like: `🐱 cat mode` and `🐶 dog mode`, this will add `+1` the option to the Firefoxs Window Title:

- `New Tab` in a Windows Title becomes,
- `New Tab 🐱 🐶`
> this does not effect a Tabs' label text, for anyone new to userchrome toggle
> 
And turning an option on via userChrome Companion, `🐱 cat mode` and `🐶 dog mode` can be communicated in userChrome.css, like:
```
:root[titlemodifier*="🐱"] {
    #navigator-toolbox {
        display: none !important;
    }
}
:root[titlemodifier*="🐶"]
    #urlbar {
        background-color: transparent !important;
    }
}
```
And obviously each option (`🐱 cat mode` or `🐶 dog mode`) can be parsed seperately or even together via the css, like:
```
/* both 🐱 🐶 present in title at the same time */
:root[titlemodifier*="🐱"][titlemodifier*="🐶"] {
    #navigator-toolbox {
        display: none !important;
    }
}

/* or */
:root[titlemodifier*="🐱 🐶"] {
    #navigator-toolbox {
        display: none !important;
    }
    #urlbar {
        background-color: transparent !important;
    }
}
```

> There is a possibility of changing this functionality to create/manipulate a single tab group as well. Setting the tabgroups's name based on toggled "options" (🐱🐶⬅️🔁) and using that to toggle userchrome styles with `:has`. Leaving window titles untouched. Maybe when the api is available..

I think the best part about this is that Theme Creators can share/use/import their own custom options by linking to it via github, like: 

[./presets/preset-example](https://github.com/soulhotel/userChrome-Companion/blob/main/presets/preset-example)

![preseturl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a4129e-88c2-4e65-8c64-68a1f30a12e9)

> works with any raw text links (including github, raw.github, codeberg, codeberg/raw)

```
05/03/2025 - 05/05/2025 v0.1
```

A rough draft to start off the Design Stage. Drag and drop mostly complete. A notification's system is needed for dynamic messages and inputs. I may have went overboard.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd301064-e785-466d-ab76-1179ff0cfc65

```
05/06/2025
```

[uc Notify](https://github.com/soulhotel/uc-notify) (Notification UI/UX kit) completed. Tabs renamed to Folders (logical). And "options" look more like tabs. Visual design adds subtle drop shadows to the list of options. And background Sidebar content is blurred (visually) upon Notify summons to simulate focus. Spacing Corrections.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab77a259-33a2-4977-961f-14965a69f9a2

```
05/31/2025 v0.5
```

A Sidebar Toolbar added to the bottom of options list. It includes a New Tab (option) button, New Folder button, and Edit Mode Button. Functionality of all three buttons are complete. New Tab & New Folder allows the creation of new options and folders through notify input. Edit Mode enters Sidebar State that allows quick renaming and deletion of options in the list. All functionality complete. Settings UI complete (with Presets, add to options, overwrite options, import @, import file, delete all options). Preset Testing done, adding options/folders via text parsed from files locally (like a .txt file), or globally (like a raw github link) complete.

Toggling on/off of individual options started. Save/load of toggle state started. Appending options character to Window Title started. `version bump to 0.5` (ready for userchrome toggling)

[./presets/readme](https://github.com/soulhotel/userChrome-Companion/blob/main/presets/readme.md)

https://github.com/soulhotel/userChrome-Companion/blob/b3165a4a04ec55848dd2c94544e266f83949c8ba/presets/preset-example#L1-L4

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45e810a6-b4c3-42a6-b3d1-3cabc84aeca7

```
06/05/2025 - 06/06/2025
```

Toggling logic seperated for UI toggling on/off state & titlepreface in window, Toggling logic centralized via syncing function (globally). Toggling and Syncing are now considerate of Sidebar states & changes (like: deletion of options, renaming, edit mode, sidebar open/close, firefox startup/window-creation). Safe guards in place. Limited access to Settings when edit mode is in progress. Limited access to toggles when edit mode is in progress. Added new Presets container for toggling options (toggle all, export toggles, import toggles), not functional yet. Added new `?` to help Users who may not understand Preset containers' buttons - it sends Users to a new & relevant userChrome Companion Wiki Page. Added a Resize helper module to assist .css with shrinking elements - for smaller than standard sidebar sizes. Code organization - I definitely feel like I'm learning js now.
